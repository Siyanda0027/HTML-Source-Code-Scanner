## How To Run The Program
* Download the JAR file included in the repository.
* Save the file to a known directory.
* Open the command line.
* Make the directory in which you saved the file the current directory.
<br>(For example, in Windows, enter this: "cd C:/Users/\<Your windows user profile name\>/Desktop/", if you saved it on your Desktop).
* Run the program via the following command: "java -jar Version1.jar".

##Current Functionality:
* The user can define a website to track and an update interval.
* The user is provided with an activity log that displays the current progress of the program.

##Intended Improvments:
* Polish the user experience (make all user visible records start at 1, not 0, etc.)
* Record the timestamp for each record creation and record comparisons.
* Allow the user to have an indefinite scan (no time limit)
* Build a UI or enhance it for command-line execution.
