## How To Run The Application
* Download the JAR file included in the repository.
* Save the file to a known directory.
* Open the command line.
* Make the directory in which you saved the file the current directory.
<br>(For example, in Windows, enter this: "cd C:/Users/\<Your windows user profile name\>/Desktop/", if you saved it on your Desktop).
* Run the application via the following command: "java -jar VersionX.Xjar" (replace "X.X" with the version that you want to run).

##Current Functionality:
* The user can define a website to track and a scanning update interval (including indefinite scans).
* The user is provided with an activity log that displays the current progress of the application.

##Intended Improvments:
* Polish the user experience
* Allow the user to filter out certain HTML code changes from registering as a change.
* Generate a "diff" when changes are found.
* Record the timestamp for each record creation and record comparisons.
* Build a UI or enhance the application for command-line execution.
